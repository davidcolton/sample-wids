# Document Summarization with Granite

[Text summarization](https://www.ibm.com/topics/text-summarization) condenses one or more texts into shorter summaries for enhanced information extraction.

The goal of this lab is to show how you can use [IBM Granite](https://www.ibm.com/granite/docs/models/granite/) models in order to apply long document summarization techniques to a work of literature.

## Prerequisites

This lab is a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/). Please follow the instructions in [pre-work](../pre-work/readme.md) to run the lab.

## Lab

To run the notebook from your command line in Jupyter using the active virtual environment from the [pre-work](../pre-work/README.md#install-jupyter), run:

```shell
jupyter-lab
```

When Jupyter Lab opens the path to the `notebooks/Summarize.ipynb` notebook file is relative to the `sample-wids` folder from the git clone in the [pre-work](../pre-work/README.md#clone-the-granite-workshop-repository). The folder navigation pane on the left-hand side can be used to navigate to the file. Once the notebook has been found it can be double clicked and it will open to the pane on the right.
